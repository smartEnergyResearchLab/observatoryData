# SERL observatory data

Code used to process the SERL [observatory datasets](https://github.com/smartEnergyResearchLab/About#observatory-data) prior to release via the UKDS. The code is organised by release data/version:

  * 4th Edition code (re-uses 2nd edition)
  * 3rd Edition code (re-uses 2nd edition)
  * [2nd Edition Code](https://github.com/smartEnergyResearchLab/observatoryData/tree/master/scripts/edition02) used to process edition 02 of the Smart Energy Research Lab [Observatory Data](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8666), 2019-2020: Secure Access 
  * [1st Edition Code](https://github.com/smartEnergyResearchLab/observatoryData/tree/master/scripts/2020_08) used to process the first edition ("2020_08") of the Smart Energy Research Lab [Observatory Data](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8666), 2019-2020: Secure Access 

As part of this repo we maintain a number of useful [functions](https://github.com/smartEnergyResearchLab/observatoryData/tree/master/scripts/functions) which are used in these data processing scripts.
