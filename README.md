# SERL observatory data

Code used to process the SERL observatory datasets prior to release via the UKDS. The code is organised by release data/version:

 * [Code](https://github.com/smartEnergyResearchLab/observatoryData/tree/master/scripts/2020_08) used to process the “Smart Energy Research Lab [Exploratory Data](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8643), 2019-2020: Secure Access” – (Study Number 8643)
 * [Code](https://github.com/smartEnergyResearchLab/observatoryData/tree/master/scripts/edition02) used to process edition 02 of the Smart Energy Research Lab [Observatory Data](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8666), 2019-2020: Secure Access 

In addition we maintain a number of useful [functions](https://github.com/smartEnergyResearchLab/observatoryData/tree/master/scripts/functions) which are re-used in the above data processing scripts.
