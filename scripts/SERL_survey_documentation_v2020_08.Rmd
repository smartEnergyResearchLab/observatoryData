# Introduction

This document describes the survey responses data table. This table includes the original survey responses data in addition to several columns that describe, summarise or attempt to clean some of the responses. Files currently available relating to the survey data are:

- *`r paste(get.serl.filename("survey_data", survey_version), ".csv", sep = "")`*: the survey data collected during the SERL pilot study - the first phase of recruitment, described in this document

- *`r paste(get.serl.filename("survey_responses", survey_version), ".csv", sep = "")`*: a report on the number of each type of response to each question in the survey, including information about response rates.


This document is structured as follows. First we describe the data collection process. The next section details the survey response columns and the meaning of the values they can take, the final section describes the remaining data fields. 

## Data collection

The SERL pilot study recruited the first wave of participants during September and October 2019. 18,000 households in central and southern England and in Wales were sent up to 4 letters inviting them to participate in SERL. All mailings encouraged sign-up online, and some of the mailings provided a paper consent form and survey to sign up by post. The consent form giving access to their smart meter data was mandatory for participation. Completion of the survey was encouraged but not required. 


The survey dataset contains `r nrow(survey_clean)` rows (one per participant who started the survey) and `r ncol(survey_clean)` columns. 

# Survey data fields: question responses

`r tab_caps("presentable2", display = "cite")` describes:

- *Survey field:* the survey question fields in the survey data table whose number corresponds to the question numbers in the survey. In some cases the questions come in multiple parts, in which case they have names such as "A13_01" and "A13_02" or "A1501" and "A1502". Some questions allowed for multiple options to be selected, in which case each option has its own column in the table with possible answers yes (selected) and no (not selected). For example question A3 has ten options, with columns named A301 - A310. There is also a box for participants to write free text. In this case that option is called "A3_Other". 

- *Approximate question:* The corresponding survey question (sometimes with approximate wording for brevity). See the electronic copy of the paper survey for the exact question wording and options.

- *Freetext option:* a binary TRUE/FALSE indicating whether participants could write free text as part of their response to the question. 

- *Possible values:* the pre-defined values that code different response options (where the responses are pre-defined). If free text is available then this may be "NA" (such as for *A3_Other*) or the free text response may not be listed (such as for *A5* which asks for the temperature households set their thermostat to).

- *Value meanings:* the response option in the survey corresponding to each value code.
